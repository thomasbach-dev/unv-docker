* Notes on Errata Levels

Actually the errata level definition passed on to the Dockerfile only exists in order to be able to
trigger rebuilds. Hence, it is not sctrictly necessary to have an actually existing errata level in
there, but it makes tracking state much easier.

To check latest errata levels, go to https://errata.software-univention.de/ and choose your UCS
version.
